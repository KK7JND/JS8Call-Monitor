"""
Python script to manage wether the JS8Call Monitor scripts prompt before
executing.

Setting the Autopilot variable below to zero, will cause the script to prompt
before making any changes. Any non-zero value will result in the script running
on autopilot, and will effect changes immediately upon invocation.

Reminder that the scripts are pointed to a local instance of JS8Call monitor,
so it must be running for the scripts to work as currently configured.
